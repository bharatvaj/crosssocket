# crosssocket
![crosssocket logo](crosssocket.png "crosssocket")  
Cross platform socket library for C for reading and writing to sockets  
Currently supports Linux, Unix and Windows

### Performance
crosssocket checks for os at compile time, so there should be no performance impact since all the functions are inline.
